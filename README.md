File Cryptor Manager
Welcome to File Cryptor Manager! Your super simple and secure tool for locking and unlocking your files. Keep your private stuff safe, right from your browser!

What's This All About?
Ever worried about keeping your personal files secure? Many encryption tools send your data to servers, don't work on all computers, or annoy you with ads and file size limits.

This project was built to fix that! We give you easy and powerful encryption without any of the clutter. Your files, your password, your computer. Simple as that.

Key Features
This tool is packed with features that put your privacy first:

Totally Private: Everything happens right in your browser using JavaScript. Your files and passwords never touch a server. Not now, not ever.

Works Everywhere: It's a web app! You can use it on Windows, macOS, or Linux. All you need is a modern web browser.

Super Strong Encryption: We use the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), a trusted and powerful algorithm used worldwide to keep data secure.

No Ads, No Limits: Encrypt files of any size without annoying pop-ups or hidden costs. It's completely free and open for you to use.

Easy Peasy: A simple, step-by-step process makes encrypting and decrypting files a breeze, even if you're not a tech wizard.
